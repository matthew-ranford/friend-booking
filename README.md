#### Wellbeing guide for stresses and needs:
-  Every time we have a standup we will have a wellbeing check-in to see how everyone is and this will be in a formal vibe file.
- Whenever anyone is stressed we have agreed that we will do one of the following: Chill time, break, fresh air, sometime to be by yourself (solitary), reassurance from others with what we are working on and positively.
- Getting enough sleep at the correct times; but if we aren't able to for some reason and we are up until 4am for instance, Won't be in at the usual time but happy to compensate by staying a bit later this evening to catch up on the work we've missed  (communication which we have agreed we are happy to have open at all times).

- 9-5 working hours where we will be working; Discussion at last standup of the day to check want we need to work on and if anyone is willing to stay and work longer hours (decide as a team).

  #### How do we make decision together? How do we handle conflicts together?
- Talking in standups at least 3 a day to check up on the progress. Possibly 1 in the morning, 1 before lunch, 1 before closing circle.
- During the standups, we will resolve in a non aggressive manner utilizing the human skills we learnt during the HM skill sessions.
  
### How will we survive?
- We are going to go out for at least one meal together, this will allow us time to relax and unwind from the project and just enjoy being in each others company. We will all eat at the same times (lunch, dinner) so that we are all away from the computers and taking a break at the same time.
- If on the small chance there is tension, we will sit down with each other and work out our tension like the mature individuals we are.
- While we have no set "fun times", we will make sure the whole project is a fun project to be apart of and enjoyable for everyone involved.


### How will you decide who needs to be present for which conversations?
- As a team we have made the decision that ALL team members will be present at all conversations regarding the product. We've made this decision because we are a small group and the product we are creating is all of ours so it makes sense for us to all be involved in conversations revolving it.
- Having everyone involved in all conversations means we are all on the exact same page with what we want from the project at that time and the direction we are taking.

### How to make sure every felt included?
- During discussions everyone will have voting power and fair share to chip in on the product.
- Making sure everyone is being heard.
- We work as a team rather than hierarchical.

### Getting the help we need technically and non-technically?
- We agree to speak up/have a conversation if we are stuck or in a tough spot and seek help if we are stuck after 20 minutes of not getting something.
- Communicate at each standup about how we all are so we know how everyone is and if they need help with anything, whether personal or technical.

### How will we work and what roles and what agile rituals will we use?

  #### We decided to keep the Scrum Facilitator, Git Keeper and Vibes Watcher roles. These roles are not strictly exclusive to individuals but a way to organize workflow.
- Scrum Facilitator = Ming, Will happy to assist
- Git Keeper = Will, Ming happy to assist
- Vibes Watcher = Matt, James
- Product Owner = Equal rights.
  
  ##### For the agile, we decided to keep doing the Kanban both digitally and physically
