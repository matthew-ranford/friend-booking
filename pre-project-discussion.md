# Pre-project discussion
Expectation setting and agreements (what do we each want out of this time, what hours will we keep, what do we do when conflict arises, how will we communicate, especially what hours work will happen over the weekend)
- When stressed or otherwise needed we each agreed we'd need time to go outside for a smoke/vape and calm down for a couple of minutes. Timing for breaks will be up to the individual, we can all agree we won't waste too much time outside

## How will you make decisions together? How will you handle conflict?
- with a group of five we can effectively place group votes
- keeping everyone in the group included in all discussions will help avoid conflicts in the first place

## How will you, individually and as a team, get the help you need both technically and non-technically?

### Individually:
- Facilitators

### Team:
- Group discussion
- Involve facilitators( if needed ) 
- Facilitators

## How will you make sure everyone feels included?/How will you decide who needs to be present for which conversations?
 - Making sure everyone has a task to work on
 - Involving everyone in group discussion ( Talking pillow )


## How will you survive (Will you eat together? How will you break the tension? What is your fun times plan?)
- Lunch period between 12 and 2, try not to go for the full 2 hours - closer 30 min means we can have smaller breaks dotted throughout the day
- Breaks
